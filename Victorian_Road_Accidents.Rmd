## Background
Towards zero is the 2016-2020 road safety strategy for the state of Victoria. The strategy is a collaboration between multiple Victorian government bodies including the Transport Accident Commission, VicRoads, Victorian Police, the Department of Justice and Regulation and the Department of Health and Human Services to achieve zero road deaths in Victoria.

The short term objective of the collaboration is to reduce annual road fatalities to below 200 by 2020 and reduce serious injuries, which require hospital admission, by 15% over the 5 year period between 2016-2020.

The Towards Zero campaign in centered upon the mantra of safer roads, safer speeds, safer vehicles and safer road users through improving infrastructure, focused education campaigns, increased monitoring and implementing innovations.

Since the implementation of the Towards Zero strategy, progress has been made to reduce both road fatalities and serious injuries.

An additional factor to consider as part of road safety are the external weather conditions road users are subject to.

### Weather Conditions as a Factor of Road Safety
_ARTICLES CONSDIERING IMPACT OF EXTERNAL FACTORS ON ACCIDENTS_
We are trying to investigate the link between extreme weather conditions and road accidents in order to improve road safety monitoring. We are illustrating the use of weather variables for analysing changes in the number of road injury accidents. Weather conditions are considered to be a factor that affects the number of road accidents and casualties significantly, with different effects according to the type of road (motorways, rural roads or urban roads). Capturing and measuring the climatic factor is not straightforward. It raises a number of issues, most importantly, how can we determine which meteorological phenomena significantly influence the road risk level, which variables are to be chosen for measuring them and also on which time scale should the weather be measured to be significant on a monthly time scale.The number of injury accidents that are recorded during inclement weather has led rain to be considered as the major meteorological explanatory factor for road accident risk (Brodsky and Hakkert, 1988). Fair weather favours mobility, while cold spells reduce it, and it seems natural to consider temperature as an appropriate variable for representing the regular changes in mobility during the year, as well as the atypical changes in mobility that occur in the event of unusually hot or cold weather. Extreme weather conditions or other natural phenomena can make large parts of the road network impassable.


## Proposed Research Questions
To further investigate the effect of external factors on Victorian road accidents, the following research questions are being proposed:   
1. How, and to what extent, do different weather conditions affect road accidents?   
2. What is the probability of a road accident occuring during wet weather, given the age of the driver?   
3. What changes, if any, to the Towards Zero campaign are recommended?   

## Data Sets
_Range of datasets examined, chosen for the analysis. How datasets were merged. Is granularity of data sufficient to answer research questions_

### Data Merging
The research questions require us to determine the weather conditions at the location of the accident by taking data from the closest weather station, gence a merge between the weather station and road accident data sets.

To determine which weather station is most appropriate for the site of a road accident, the distance between the two is to be quantified. The cross join returns m*n number of results. Then we will take only those readings contain minimum value of distance calculated.

## Regression Modelling
_Regression modelling techniques to be employed_


## Issues
Throughout the project, the following have been identified as potential issues to consider and address:
- accurately assigning weather conditions to each road accident
- merging and joining data sets
- working with low quality data sets
- compensating for missing explanatory variables
- complexity of capturing and measuring weather variables

It raises a number of issues, most importantly, how can we determine which meteorological phenomena significantly influence the road risk level, which variables are to be chosen for measuring them and also on which time scale should the weather be measured to be significant on a monthly time scale.

#### Reading Libraries
``` {r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(esquisse)
library(geosphere)
```

#### Reading Data
``` {r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
accident <- read.csv("Datasets/Road Crashes/ACCIDENT.csv")
climate86018 <- read.csv("Datasets/Climate/86018.csv")
accident_node <-  read.csv("Datasets/Road Crashes/NODE.CSV")
```

#### Data Transformation

```{r}
glimpse(accident)

glimpse(climate86018)

#Adding station latitude and longitude to all rows (to calculate distance between the accident and climate station)
climate86018$station_lat <- rep(-37.8795,nrow(climate86018))
climate86018$station_long <- rep(145.0368,nrow(climate86018))

#Converting fct to date
accident$ACCIDENTDATE <- as.Date(accident$ACCIDENTDATE, "%d/%m/%Y")
climate86018$YYYY.MM.DD  <- as.Date (climate86018$YYYY.MM.DD, "%Y-%m-%d")

#Rename date columns (to be used as primary key between accidents and climate data)
accident <- accident %>% rename (DATE = ACCIDENTDATE)
climate86018 <- climate86018 %>% rename (DATE = YYYY.MM.DD)
```

#### Merging Data
```{r}
#Creating mergedFiles object, which contains accident, accident location and climate data
mergedFiles <- merge(accident,accident_node,by="ACCIDENT_NO")
mergedFiles <- merge(mergedFiles, climate86018,by="DATE")

#Adding dist_station_crash column with distance between accident location and climate observatory
mergedFiles <- mergedFiles %>% 
	mutate(dist_station_crash = distHaversine(cbind(station_long, station_lat), cbind(Long, Lat)))

glimpse(mergedFiles)
