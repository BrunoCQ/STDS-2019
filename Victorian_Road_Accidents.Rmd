## Background
Towards zero is the 2016-2020 road safety strategy

VicRoads is the sate government body that manages and regulates the main road network within the Victorian state, with a goal to create a smarter and safer road network across the state. Along with delivering road safety initiatives, VicRoads provides registration and licensing services for all motor vehicles.

In 2016, VicRoads implemented their "Towards Zero" strategy, initially aimed at reducing annual road fatalities to below 200 by 2020.    
As part of this action plan, VicRoads aims to reduce serious injuries by 15% over the 5 year period between 2016-2020. A serious injury is defined as an injury requiring admission into hospital.

Since the implementation of the "Towards Zero" strategy, progress has been made across all categories in reducing

The "Towards Zero" campaign has focussed their investments on a few key areas, notably the creation of a physically safer en, a Road Safety Education Complex, increasing

The campaign currently focuses on physically creating a safer environment, education and increased monitoring to tackle road safety issues.


### Weather Conditions as a
_ARTICLES CONSDIERING IMPACT OF EXTERNAL FACTORS ON ACCIDENTS_
We are trying to investigate the link between extreme weather conditions and road accidents in order to improve road safety monitoring. We are illustrating the use of weather variables for analysing changes in the number of road injury accidents. 

Weather conditions are considered to be a factor that affects the number of road accidents and casualties significantly, with different effects according to the type of road (motorways, rural roads or urban roads). 
Capturing and measuring the climatic factor is not straightforward. 

It raises a number of issues, most importantly, how can we determine which meteorological phenomena significantly influence the road risk level, which variables are to be chosen for measuring them and also on which time scale should the weather be measured to be significant on a monthly time scale.

The number of injury accidents that are recorded during inclement weather has led rain to be considered as the major meteorological explanatory factor for road accident risk (Brodsky and Hakkert, 1988). 

Fair weather favours mobility, while cold spells reduce it, and it seems natural to consider temperature as an appropriate variable for representing the regular changes in mobility during the year, as well as the atypical changes in mobility that occur in the event of unusually hot or cold weather. 

Extreme weather conditions or other natural phenomena can make large parts of the road network impassable.

Even though VicRoads is unable to control external weather factors, precautionary measures and targeted educational campaigns backed by statistics may contribute towards a reduction in motor vehicle accidents.

## Proposed Research Questions
To further investigate the effect of external factors on road crashes, the following research questions are being proposed:   
1. How, and to what extent, do different weather conditions affect road accidents?   
2. What is the probability of a road accident occuring during wet weather, given the age of the driver?   
3. What changes, if any, to current road policies and campaigns are recommended?   

## Data Sets
_Range of datasets examined, chosen for the analysis. How datasets were merged. Is granularity of data sufficient to answer research questions_


## Regression Modelling
_Regression modelling techniques to be employed_


## Issues
Throughout the project, the following have been identified as potential issues:
- accurately assigning weather conditions to each motor vehicle accident
- merging and joining data sets
- working with low quality data sets
- compensating for missing explanatory variables
-
