## Background
VicRoads is the sate government body that manages and regulates the main road network within the Victorian state, with a goal to create a smarter and safer road network across the state. Along with delivering road safety initiatives, VicRoads provides registration and licensing services for all motor vehicles.

In 2016, VicRoads implemented their "Towards Zero" strategy, initially aimed at reducing annual road fatalities to below 200 by 2020.    
As part of this action plan, VicRoads aims to reduce serious injuries by 15% over the 5 year period between 2016-2020.

Over the past 5 years, fatalities have decreased towards the target of 200, but a large number of motor vehicle accidents still occur.Although ViCRoads have achieved a 25% reduction in serious injuries, well over the intended 15% reduction, 27,274 persons were still involved in a motor vehicle accidents of which 14% were either fatal or seriously injured, requiring admission into hospital.

The campaign currently uses....... to tackle road safety issues.


To assist in reducing the percentage of serious injuries ViCRoads has invested in key areas, including focussed training and information on higher

_ARTICLES CONSDIERING IMPACT OF EXTERNAL FACTORS ON ACCIDENTS_

Even though VicRoads is unable to control external weather factors, precautionary measures and targeted educational campaigns backed by statistics may contribute towards a reduction in motor vehicle accidents.

## Proposed Research Questions
To further investigate the effect of external factors on road crashes, the following research questions are being proposed:   
1. How, and to what extent, do different weather conditions affect road accidents?   
2. What is the probability of a road accident occuring during wet weather, given the age of the driver?   
3. What changes, if any, to current road policies and campaigns are recommended?   

## Data Sets
_Range of datasets examined, chosen for the analysis. How datasets were merged. Is granularity of data sufficient to answer research questions_


## Regression Modelling
_Regression modelling techniques to be employed_


## Issues
Throughout the project, the following have been identified as potential issues:
- accurately assigning weather conditions to each motor vehicle accident
- merging and joining data sets
- working with low quality data sets
- compensating for missing explanatory variables
-
